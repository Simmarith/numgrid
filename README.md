# NumGrid
I've played a game with the same mechanic on my phone a bunch but they want like 5 Bucks a month for it. So here's my interpretation of it.

## Installation
I've currently only built it for windows (see releases tab). The .exe works with wine on mac as well. I haven't tested linux so far, but please tell me if that works. You can always just import the whole project into godot and play it over the debugger or export it yourself.
